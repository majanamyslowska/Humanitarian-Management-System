# Humanitarian Management System - OOP in Python & SQLite

This repository hosts the Humanitarian Management System, a Python-based application developed using object-oriented programming principles to enhance resource distribution and information management across refugee camps. Key features include:

- Robust Data Handling: Utilizes SQLite for secure and efficient management of data, including user authentication, refugee profile management, and resource allocation tracking.
- Data Integrity and Persistence: Designed to maintain data integrity and persistence with thorough system testing protocols to ensure functionality and reliability in real-world scenarios.
- Streamlined Operations: Aims to streamline operations within refugee camps, making resource distribution more efficient and improving overall camp management.
- User-Friendly Interface: Features a GUI built with Tkinter, providing an intuitive and accessible interface for users to interact with the system effectively.

Developed as part of a project at University College London (UCL), March 2024.
